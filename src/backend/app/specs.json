schema validation for incoming events.\n- Access controls and data masking for sensitive data.\n\n3.3 Multi-Region and Disaster Recovery\n- Active-active regions for critical services; eventual consistency for non-critical data.\n- Data replication and failover strategies; circuit breakers for dependency failures.\n\n4) Testing Criteria\n\n4.1 Testing Strategy\n- Unit tests: individual components (feature extraction, health checks, helper utilities).\n- Integration tests: end-to-end flows from data ingestion to API responses.\n- Contract tests: verify API inputs/outputs against schemas; GraphQL and REST contracts.\n- Data quality tests: schema validation, null checks, range validation, anomaly detection on ingested data.\n- Model evaluation tests: offline metrics comparisons against baselines; backtesting for pricing models.\n- A/B testing readiness: ensure experiment definitions align with statistical power requirements.\n\n4.2 Load and Resilience Testing\n- Load testing: simulate 10k+ concurrent users; measure latency budgets and queue depths.\n- Spike testing: emulate Black Friday-like traffic with autoscaling tests.\n- Chaos testing: introduce random failures (service outages, latency spikes) and verify resilience and automatic recovery.\n\n4.3 Security and Compliance Testing\n- Penetration testing for APIs; verify OAuth2 flows and token lifetimes.\n- Data privacy checks: ensure PII masking in logs; verify data deletion workflows.\n\n5) Acceptance Criteria\n\n5.1 MVP (Phase 1)\n- Functional\n  - Real-time personalized recommendations available on homepage and PDP with top-N results.\n  - Dynamic pricing able to compute price adjustments for at least 80% of catalog items within acceptable latency windows.\n  - Basic A/B framework deployed with at least one pricing experiment running.\n- Performance\n  - Recommendation latency \u2264 100 ms for top-N; pricing calculations \u2264 50 ms.\n  - System achieves 99.95% uptime with automated failover across two regions.\n- Data and ML\n  - Offline evaluation shows NDCG@10 improved by at least 5% versus a baseline.\n  - Data quality gates pass (no critical schema violations, freshness within defined thresholds).\n- Observability\n  - Dashboards for ML metrics and business KPIs;
