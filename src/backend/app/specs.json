    "plan": "Below is a comprehensive, technology-agnostic implementation plan that you can tailor to your actual specification. The plan assumes a modern, service-oriented/web API style architecture and provides concrete artifacts (templates, examples) you can adapt as needed.\n\n---\n\n# 1) Architecture Overview\n\nObjective: deliver a maintainable, scalable, and testable system that supports future evolution while aligning with common modern practices.\n\nProposed Architectural Patterns\n- Layered/Hexagonal (Clean) Architecture for backend services\n  - Separation of concerns: API Layer, Application/Service Layer, Domain/Business Layer, Persistence Layer\n  - Easy testing in isolation (unit tests for each layer, mocks for adjacent layers)\n- Optional: Microservices vs Monolith\n  - Monolith (recommended for early-stage or smaller teams): single deployable unit with modular boundaries (packages/modules, clean API surface)\n  - Microservices (for larger scale or clear domain boundaries): split by bounded contexts (e.g., Auth, Catalog, Scheduling) with clear API contracts and asynchronous messaging where appropriate\n- API-first approach\n  - RESTful API design with defined OpenAPI/Swagger specifications\n  - Versioning (e.g., /api/v1/\u2026), backward-compatible evolution plan\n- Data/Integration\n  - Synchronous: REST/GraphQL for CRUD operations\n  - Asynchronous: message bus (e.g., Kafka/RabbitMQ) for events and integration with downstream systems\n- Deployment/Runtime\n  - Containerized workloads\n  - Orchestrated deployment (Kubernetes) or serverless where appropriate\n  - Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform) and repeatable CI/CD pipelines\n- Observability and Security\n  - Centralized logging, metrics, tracing\n  - Secure by default: authentication, authorization, secret management, encryption in transit/at rest\n\nReference Architecture (textual)\n- Clients (Web/Mobile) -> API Gateway\n- API Gateway routes requests to Backend Services\n  - Authentication/Authorization service (OIDC/OAuth2, JWT validation)\n  - Core Domain Services (e.g., ResourceService, UserService)\n  - Optional Shared Services (AuditService, NotificationService)\n  - Data Stores (PostgreSQL/SQL for relational data; Redis for caching; S3/GCS for object storage)\n  - Message Bus (Kafka/RabbitMQ) for events and decoupled workflows\n- Observability Layer (Prometheus/Grafana, OpenTelemetry, ELK/EFK)\n- SecOps Layer (WAF, IAM policies, secret mgmt)\n\nKey Non-Functional Considerations\n- Security: identity, least-privilege access, encryption, secrets management\n- Reliability: retries with backoff, idempotency keys, circuit breakers\n- Performance: caching strategy, optimized queries, pagination\n- Compliance: audit trails, data retention, access controls\n- Maintainability: clear module boundaries, documentation, CI/CD quality gates\n\n---\n\n# 2) Technical Requirements\n\nNote: This section provides a robust baseline. Fill in specifics once the actual requirements are defined.\n\nFunctional Requirements (baseline)\n- User management\n  - Create, read, update, delete user accounts\n  - Roles and permissions with role-based access control\n  - Password management with secure storage, reset flows, MFA support (optional)\n- Resource management (core domain)\n  - CRUD operations for a generic Resource (or the primary domain entity)\n  - Search, filter, sort, and pagination\n  - Validation and business rule enforcement\n- Auditing and observability\n  - Audit logs for create/update/delete actions\n  - Event emission for significant domain events\n- API access\n  - Secure REST API with token-based authentication\n  - Rate limiting and quota enforcement\n  - API versioning and deprecation strategy\n- Notification (optional)\n  - Webhook support or internal notification mechanism for significant events\n- Data persistence\n  - Durable storage with ACID properties where applicable\n  - Data retention and archival policies\n\nNon-Functional Requirements\n- Performance and scalability\n  - Target response times for core endpoints\n  - Horizontal scalability (stateless services)\n- Availability\n  - SLO/SLI targets (e.g., 99.9% uptime in production)\n- Security and Compliance\n  - OWASP Top 10 mitigations\n  - Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+), encryption at rest where required\n  - Secrets management (e.g., Vault, cloud KMS)\n- maintainability and QA\n  - Clear code quality gates (linters, type checks, tests)\n  - Comprehensive automated tests and clear documentation\n- Observability\n  - Centralized logging, metrics, tracing\n  - Health checks and readiness probes\n\nTechnical Constraints (placeholder to tailor)\n- Technology choices to be filled: language, framework, database, hosting, CI/CD platform, etc.\n- Compliance/regulatory constraints (if any)\n- Budget and time constraints\n- Availability of personnel and expertise\n\nProposed Default Technology Options (modifiable)\n- Backend language: TypeScript (Node.js) or Java (Spring Boot) or Go\n- API: RESTful design with OpenAPI 3.0\n- Database: PostgreSQL (relational), Redis (cache/fast lookup)\n- Messaging: Kafka or RabbitMQ\n- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect;

user_id (PK)\n  - username\n  - email\n  - hashed_password\n  - status (active/inactive)\n  - created_at, updated_at\n- Role\n  - role_id (PK)\n  - name (e.g., admin, user, viewer)\n  - description\n- UserRole (association)\n  - user_id (FK -> User)\n  - role_id (FK -> Role)\n- Resource (generic domain item)\n  - resource_id (PK)\n  - name\n  - description\n  - owner_id (FK -> User)\n  - status\n  - created_at, updated_at\n- AuditLog\n  - log_id (PK)\n  - user_id (FK -> User)\n  - action (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE)\n  - resource (string or FK to Resource)\n  - resource_id\n  - timestamp\n  - details (JSON)\n- Event\n  - event_id (PK)\n  - event_type\n  - payload (JSON)\n  - created_at\n- Indexes and constraints\n  - Unique constraints on usernames/emails\n  - Foreign key constraints with cascade rules as appropriate\n  - Time-to-live or archival strategies for audit logs (partitioning)\n\nRelational Schema (SQL sketch, PostgreSQL)\n- CREATE TABLE users (\n    user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n    username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n    hashed_password TEXT NOT NULL,\n    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',\n    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),\n    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()\n  );\n- CREATE TABLE roles (\n    role_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n    name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n    description TEXT\n  );\n- CREATE TABLE user_roles (\n    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n    role_id UUID REFERENCES roles(role_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, role_id)\n  );\n- CREATE TABLE resources (\n    resource_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n    name TEXT NOT NULL,\n    description TEXT,\n    owner_id UUID REFERENCES users(user_id),\n    status TEXT,\n    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),\n    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()\n  );\n- CREATE TABLE audit_logs (\n    log_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(user_id),\n    action TEXT NOT NULL,\n    resource TEXT,\n    resource_id UUID,\n    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),\n    details JSONB\n  );\n\nNoSQL / Document-oriented (optional)\n- If using a NoSQL store for certain datasets, define:\n  - Collections: users, roles, resources, audits\n  - Denormalization strategy for read performance with upserts and versioning\n  - Change streams or hooks for event-driven updates\n\nData Migration Considerations\n- Versioned migrations with a tool (e.g., Flyway, Liquibase, Prisma Migrate)\n- Backward-compatible changes when possible\n- Seed data for development and testing environments\n- Data anonymization for test environments\n\nData Retention and Privacy\n- Retain audit logs and resource history per policy\n- Archive old records to cheaper storage or purge according to compliance rules\n- PII handling: mask or encrypt sensitive fields as needed\n\n---\n\n# 6) Testing Strategy\n\nQuality Assurance Pyramid (tailored for backend/API)\n\n- Unit Testing (core)\n  - Goals: validate business logic in isolation\n  - Coverage targets: 70\u201380%\n  - Tools: language-native testing frameworks (JUnit/TestNG for Java; Jest/Jest-Typescript for Node.js; pytest for Python)\n  - Mocking: mocks/stubs for dependencies (repositories, external services)\n\n- Integration Testing (surface-level)\n  - Goals: test interactions between components (service-to-repository, API-to-auth, etc.)\n  - Coverage targets: 40\u201360%\n  - Approaches: in-container databases, test doubles for external services, containerized test environment\n  - Data: use a test schema or dedicated test data\n\n- Contract Testing\n  - Goals: ensure API contracts between services/components are upheld\n  - Tools: Pact, OpenAPI validators\n  - Pipelines: run on PRs and in CI\n\n- End-to-End (E2E) Testing\n  - Goals: validate complete user flows against the running system\n  - Scope: representative scenarios across authentication, resource management, auditing\n  - Tools: Playwright, Cypress, or Selenium (for web flows); Postman/Newman for API workflows\n  - Data: dedicated test data sets; deterministic fixtures\n\n- Performance/Load Testing\n  - Goals: verify performance and scaling under load\n  - Scenarios: read-heavy, write-heavy, burst traffic\n  - Tools: k6, Locust\n  - Thresholds: define acceptable latency, error rates, RPS targets\n\n- Security Testing\n  - Goals: identify common vulnerabilities (injection, auth flaws, misconfigurations)\n  - Techniques: static code analysis, dependency scanning, dynamic testing, dependency vulnerability management\n  - Tools: Snyk, OWASP ZAP, dependency track\n\nTest Data Strategy\n- Seed data for development and test environments\n- Data masking for production-like test data\n- Separate environments for dev, test, staging, and prod\n- CI-driven test data refresh and teardown\n\nCI/CD Integration\n- Gate quality checks before merges (lint, type checks, unit tests)\n- Parallel test execution where feasible\n- Automated migration execution in test environments\n- Canary/B staging deployments to validate non-functional aspects before production\n\nAcceptance Criteria\n- Define clear pass criteria for MVP and subsequent features\n- Document expected API behavior, error handling, and edge cases\n\n---\n\n# 7) Deployment Considerations\n\nEnvironment and Infrastructure\n- Environments: dev, test, staging, prod\n- Deployment model: containerized services on Kubernetes or serverless functions\n- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform or CloudFormation for reproducible environments\n\nCI/CD and Release Management\n- Source control: feature branches, pull requests with mandatory reviews\n- Pipelines: automated build, test, security scans, and deployment\n- Release strategies: canary, blue/green, or rolling updates\n- Rollback: predefined rollback plan and automated rollback mechanisms\n\nObservability and Reliability\n- Monitoring: metrics (Prometheus), dashboards (Grafana)\n- Tracing: OpenTelemetry with traces (Jaeger/Tempo)\n- Logging: centralized logs (ELK/EFK or cloud equivalents)\n- Health checks: readiness and liveness probes\n- Alerting: incident response SLAs, on-call runbooks\n\nSecurity and Compliance\n- Identity and access: IAM roles, least privilege, token validation\n- Secrets management: vault or cloud secret manager\n- Transport security: TLS everywhere\n- WAF and security controls at the edge (if exposed)\n- Regular vulnerability scanning and dependency updates\n\nData Management\n- Database backups and disaster recovery plans\n- Point-in-time recovery where supported\n- Data retention policies and archival processes\n- Data localization considerations (if required)\n\nOperational Readiness\n- Runbooks for deployment, rollback, incident response, and recovery\n- On-call rotation and escalation paths\n- Change management and approval processes for production changes\n\nScaling and Cost Management\n- Horizontal scalability and auto-scaling policies\n- Cost monitoring and optimization strategies\n- Resource requests/limits in Kubernetes or equivalent\n\nMigration Plan (if upgrading or migrating)\n- Cutover strategy and downtime windows\n- Data migration tooling and verification\n- Backout plan and testing of rollback\n\n---\n\n# 8) Assumptions, Gaps, and Next Steps\n\n- Assumptions\n  - The system is API-first and backend-driven; front-end teams will consume the API.\n  - A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) is acceptable for core data; NoSQL can be introduced for specific use cases.\n  - Kubernetes or serverless platforms are available for deployment.\n\n- Gaps to Resolve (fill in during planning)\n  - Specific domain entities and business rules\n  - Target technology stack (programming language, frameworks, databases)\n  - Security requirements (MFA, SCIM, SSO integration, data residency)\n  - Data retention and privacy policies\n  - Exact performance targets (latency, throughput)\n\n- Next Steps\n  - Gather detailed functional and non-functional requirements\n  - Define the domain model with stakeholders\n  - Choose the technology stack and architecture (monolith vs microservices)\n  - Create a concrete OpenAPI specification and data model\n  - Set up initial CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure templates\n  - Develop the MVP in iterative sprints with automated tests\n\n---\n\nIf you can share concrete details (domain, target tech stack, compliance needs, scale, and timelines), I can tailor this plan into a precise, executable blueprint with concrete artifacts, diagrams, and a project timeline.",

    "plan": "# Technical Implementation Plan\n\nA comprehensive plan to build a simple web-based task management app using:\n- Frontend: React with TypeScript + Tailwind CSS\n- Backend: Node.js with Express\n- Database: PostgreSQL\n- API: RESTful design\n- Architecture: SPA with a REST API, modern UI, responsive design\n\n---\n\n## 1) Architecture Overview\n\n- Frontend (Client)\n  - Tech: React + TypeScript, React Hooks for state management, Tailwind CSS for styling\n  - Responsibilities: UI rendering, client-side validation, optimistic UI updates, API communication, routing (SPA)\n  - Local state management: useState / useEffect / useReducer; optional small context or custom hooks for task data\n  - Styling: Tailwind CSS, responsive design for mobile devices\n\n- Backend (Server)\n  - Tech: Node.js with Express, TypeScript\n  - Responsibilities: RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks, input validation, business rules, data access via Prisma ORM, error handling, CORS, security basics\n  - Data access: PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM (type-safe)\n  - Additional: Simple authentication is optional for future expansion; initial MVP is unauthenticated\n\n- Database\n  - Tech: PostgreSQL\n  - Data model: Task table with fields for id, title, description, due date, priority, timestamps\n  - Migrations: Prisma migrations to create/update schema\n\n- Deployment & Ops\n  - Local development: Docker Compose or separate Dockerfiles for frontend/backend with a Postgres service\n  - Production: Dockerized services behind a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) or cloud-hosted containers; environment variables for config; migrations run during startup\n  - CI/CD: Optional; linting, type checks, tests, and build steps in pipeline\n\n- Data Flow\n  - User -> Frontend UI -> API calls -> Backend validates and persists data -> Frontend updates UI with results\n  - All data operations are performed via REST endpoints under /api/tasks\n\n---\n\n## 2) Technical Requirements\n\nFunctional Requirements\n- Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) tasks\n- Each task includes:\n  - Title (string, required)\n  - Description (string, optional)\n  - Due date (Date)\n  - Priority level (enum: low, medium, high, critical)\n- UI must be responsive and accessible in modern browsers\n- SPA with client-side routing and clean UI\n- Sorting/filtering: basic sorting by due date or priority; optional search by title\n- Persist data in PostgreSQL\n- RESTful API design with predictable endpoints and status codes\n\nNon-Functional Requirements\n- Performance: responsive UI; efficient rendering with React hooks; minimal API latency acceptable for a small dataset\n- Security: Input validation, basic error handling, CORS configured for client origin\n- Compatibility: Modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari); responsive design for mobile\n- Maintainability: Type-safe code (TypeScript); modular architecture; clear API contracts\n- Deployability: Dockerized services; simple startup sequence; environment-driven configuration\n\nFrontend Highlights\n- React functional components with TypeScript\n- Hooks: useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo, useReducer (optional)\n- Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive layout\n- Minimal routing for pages: Task List, Task Form (Create/Edit)\n\nBackend Highlights\n- Express app with TypeScript\n- Prisma ORM for PostgreSQL\n- Validation via Zod (type-safe runtime validation)\n- RESTful routes under /api/tasks\n- Error handling middleware\n- Lightweight auth scaffolding left out for MVP (can be added later)\n\nDatabase & Data Model\n- PostgreSQL with a Task table\n- Prisma schema with task model and priority enum\n- Migrations tracked via Prisma\n\nTesting & Quality\n- Unit tests for backend validators/services\n- Integration tests for API endpoints (supertest)\n- Frontend component tests (React Testing Library)\n- Optional E2E tests (Cypress) for core flows\n\nDeployment\n- Local development via Docker Compose (frontend, backend, PostgreSQL)\n- Production-ready Dockerfiles with multi-stage builds\n- Environment variables for config (DB URL, API base URL, etc.)\n- Optional: simple CI to run tests and linting\n\n---\n\n## 3) Implementation Approach\n\nPhased Plan\n\nPhase 1: Project Scaffolding\n- Create a monorepo or clearly separated frontend/backend folders\n- Initialize frontend with Vite + React + TS, Tailwind CSS setup\n- Initialize backend with Express + TS, Prisma setup\n- Create PostgreSQL database locally (via Docker or installed instance)\n- Add ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript configs\n\nPhase 2: Data Layer\n- Define Prisma schema for Task (id, title, description, dueDate, priority, createdAt, updatedAt)\n- Add Prisma migrations and seed (optional)\n- Implement Prisma client usage in backend for CRUD operations\n\nPhase 3: Backend API\n- Implement REST endpoints:\n  - GET /api/tasks\n  - GET /api/tasks/:id\n  - POST /api/tasks\n  - PUT /api/tasks/:id\n  - DELETE /api/tasks/:id\n- Validate input with Zod\n- Implement error handling middleware\n- Add basic filters/sorting on GET /api/tasks (limit, offset, sort)\n- Ensure proper HTTP status codes and error messages\n\nPhase 4: Frontend UI\n- Build SPA with:\n  - TaskList component (list, sort, search, pagination if desired)\n  - TaskForm component (create/edit)\n  - TaskCard or table rows\n- Implement API client to communicate with backend\n- Use React Router for navigation (e.g., /tasks, /tasks/new, /tasks/:id/edit)\n- Tailwind-based responsive layout and a clean UI\n- Client-side validation before submission (optional; server validation remains authoritative)\n- Local optimistic updates where appropriate (e.g., after create/edit/delete)\n\nPhase 5: Testing\n- Backend: unit tests + integration tests for API endpoints\n- Frontend: unit tests for components and hooks; integration tests for API client with mocked responses\n- Optional: E2E tests for core flows\n\nPhase 6: Deployment\n- Create Dockerfiles for backend and frontend; compose into a single docker-compose.yml for dev\n- Prepare production-ready Docker setup (multi-stage build, minimal image)\n- Define environment variables for DB connection, API base URL, etc.\n- Plan for migrations on startup in production\n- Basic monitoring/logging suggestions\n\nPhase 7: Documentation & Next Steps\n- API docs (swagger or OpenAPI spec) optional\n- In-app UX hints and accessibility improvements\n- Future enhancements: user authentication, multi-user projects, tags, reminders, reminders/notifications, offline support\n\n---\n\n## 4) API Design\n\nResource: Task\n- Attributes:\n  - id: string (UUID)\n  - title: string\n  - description: string | null\n  - dueDate: string (ISO 8601 date-time)\n  - priority: enum('low','medium','high','critical')\n  - createdAt: string (ISO date-time)\n  - updatedAt: string (ISO date-time)\n\nEndpoints\n\n1) GET /api/tasks\n- Description: List tasks with optional pagination and sorting\n- Query parameters:\n  - limit?: number (default 20)\n  - offset?: number (default 0)\n  - sort?: string (e.g., dueDate_asc, dueDate_desc, priority_asc, priority_desc)\n- Response: 200 OK\n  - Body: { tasks: Task[], totalCount: number }\n- Errors: 500\n\n2) GET /api/tasks/:id\n- Description: Retrieve a single task\n- Response: 200 OK\n  - Body: Task\n- Errors: 404 Not Found if not exists; 400/500 for invalid id or server error\n\n3) POST /api/tasks\n- Description: Create a new task\n- Request body:\n  - { title: string, description?: string, dueDate: string, priority: 'low'|'medium'|'high'|'critical' }\n- Validation: title required; dueDate valid date; priority in enum\n- Response: 201 Created\n  - Body: Task\n- Errors: 400 ValidationError; 500\n\n4) PUT /api/tasks/:id\n- Description: Update an existing task (full update)\n- Request body: { title: string, description?: string, dueDate: string, priority: 'low'|'medium'|'high'|'critical' }\n- Response: 200 OK\n  - Body: Task\n- Errors: 400, 404, 500\n\n5) DELETE /api/tasks/:id\n- Description: Delete a task\n- Response: 204 No Content\n- Errors: 404, 500\n\nValidation & Error Handling\n- Use Zod schemas on request bodies\n- Centralized error handling middleware to map validation errors to 400 and not-found errors to 404\n- Consistent error response shape:\n  - { error: 'ValidationError', message: 'Title is required', details?: { field: 'title' } }\n\nSecurity & Best Practices\n- Enable CORS for frontend origin in development; in production restrict to known domains\n- Input validation on server (not solely client-side)\n- Do not leak internal error details to clients\n\nSample Data Payloads\n\nCreate:\n{\n  \"title\": \"Finish project onboarding\",\n  \"description\": \"Complete initial setup and add todos\",\n  \"dueDate\": \"2025-09-30T17:00:00.000Z\",\n  \"priority\": \"high\"\n}\n\nUpdate:\n{\n  \"title\": \"Finish project onboarding (Updated)\",\n  \"description\": \"Adjust scope and add subtasks\",\n  \"dueDate\": \"2025-10-05T17:00:00.000Z\",\n  \"priority\": \"medium\"\n}\n\n---\n\n## 5) Data Models\n\nPrisma Schema ( Prisma 4.x style )\n\nmodel Task {\n  id          String   @id @default(uuid())\n  title       String\n  description String?\n  dueDate     DateTime\n  priority    Priority\n  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())\n  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt\n}\n\nenum Priority {\n  low\n  medium\n  high\n  critical\n}\n\n datasource db {\n  provider = \"postgresql\"\n  url      = env(\"DATABASE_URL\")\n}\n\ngenerator client {\n  provider = \"prisma-client-js\"\n}\n\nNotes\n- id is a UUID for portability across environments\n- dueDate stored as DateTime with ISO 8601 handling\n- createdAt and updatedAt help with auditing and UI sorting\n- Prisma migrations will generate the PostgreSQL schema\n\nPostgreSQL Table Sketch (equivalent at SQL level)\n- Table: tasks\n  - id UUID PRIMARY KEY\n  - title VARCHAR NOT NULL\n  - description TEXT\n  - due_date TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL\n  - priority VARCHAR NOT NULL CHECK (priority IN ('low','medium','high','critical'))\n  - created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()\n  - updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()\n\nIndexes\n- Index on due_date (for sorting)\n- Index on priority (for quick sorting/filtering)\n- Optional composite index on (due_date, priority) if queried together\n\nFrontend Data Model (TypeScript)\n- interface Task {\n  id: string;\n  title: string;\n  description?: string;\n  dueDate: string; // ISO 8601\n  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';\n  createdAt?: string;\n  updatedAt?: string;\n}\n\n---\n\n## 6) Testing Strategy\n\nBackend Testing\n- Unit tests\n  - Validate Zod schemas (e.g., missing title, invalid dueDate, invalid priority)\n  - Test service/repository logic in isolation with an in-memory or test DB\n- Integration tests\n  - API endpoint tests using supertest\n  - Test GET, POST, PUT, DELETE with valid and invalid inputs\n  - Validate pagination/sorting behavior\n- End-to-end tests (optional)\n  - Basic flow with a real test DB to ensure API and Prisma integration works\n\nFrontend Testing\n- Unit/Component tests\n  - TaskForm: validates required fields, proper payload construction\n  - TaskList: renders list, shows loading/error states\n- Hook/Client logic tests\n  - Custom hooks for API calls and state updates\n- Integration tests\n  - API client layer using mocked fetch/axios\n\nAccessibility & UI\n- Keyboard navigability for forms\n- Proper aria labels for controls\n- High-contrast color combinations (Tailwind defaults can help)\n\nTest Data & Environment\n- Separate test database configuration\n- Seed test data for integration tests\n- CI should set up test DB, run migrations, and execute test suites\n\n---\n\n## 7) Deployment Considerations\n\nLocal Development\n- Use Docker Compose to bring up:\n  - frontend container (Vite dev server or static build)\n  - backend container (Node/Express server)\n  - postgres database container\n- Environment variables:\n  - DATABASE_URL (Postgres connection string)\n  - API_BASE_URL (for frontend to reach backend)\n  - NODE_ENV (development)\n- Migrations: Run Prisma migrate dev to apply schema\n\nProduction Deployment (simple path)\n- Build assets:\n  - Frontend: npm run build (Vite)\n  - Backend: npm run build (tsc) if using ts-node in prod; or use ts-node in dev only\n- Dockerization:\n  - Backend Dockerfile (node:18-alpine, multi-stage build to copy compiled JS)\n  - Frontend Dockerfile (nginx or serve for static assets, or use node with serve)\n- Docker Compose (production-friendly variant)\n  - Services: db (PostgreSQL), backend, frontend\n  - Networks: app network\n  - Volumes: persistent DB data\n  - Health checks and restart policies\n- Database Migrations\n  - Run Prisma migrate deploy on startup of backend\n- Security & TLS\n  - Place behind a reverse proxy (Nginx) with TLS termination\n  - Use strong TLS configuration and regular certificate renewals\n- Observability\n  - Centralized logs from backend and frontend\n  - Optional metrics (e.g., Prometheus) and tracing\n- Backups\n  - Regular PostgreSQL backups (cron job or managed service)\n  - Restore procedures documented\n\nSimple Deployment Steps (local to production)\n- 1) Ensure PostgreSQL is reachable and DATABASE_URL is set\n- 2) Install dependencies for backend and frontend\n- 3) Run migrations (backend)\n- 4) Start backend and frontend services (via Docker or directly)\n- 5) Verify API endpoints and UI flows\n\nEnvironment and Configuration\n- Use environment variables for:\n  - DATABASE_URL\n  - PORT (backend)\n  - FRONTEND_BASE_URL or API_BASE_URL\n  - NODE_ENV\n- Document defaults and required vars\n\nExtensibility Considerations\n- Future auth: add user table and JWT-based authentication; scope tasks per user\n- Multi-user support: links tasks to userId; add access checks\n- Features to consider later: tags/categories, reminders/notifications, drag-and-drop prioritization, offline capability with service workers\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Deliverables\n\n- A responsive, clean UI built with React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS\n- A RESTful API with endpoints for full CRUD on tasks\n- PostgreSQL as the data store with Prisma ORM\n- Clean separation of concerns (frontend, backend, data layer)\n- Clear API contracts, data models, and validation rules\n- Documentation and guidance for local development and production deployment\n- Testing strategy covering backend and frontend layers\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can provide:\n- A starter repository structure with initial files\n- Sample Prisma schema and Express routes\n- Example frontend components and API client scaffolding\n- Docker Compose files for development and production-ready setups",
